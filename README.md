# Model Predictive Control (MPC) Assignments

This repository contains the coursework for the **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** module. The assignments focus on various control methods, particularly finite-time optimal control, Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR), and nonlinear MPC with a specific focus on an Astrobee rendezvous maneuver. Below is a breakdown of the included assignments and their topics:

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Discrete-time Linear Systems
- **Description**: This assignment covered the fundamentals of discrete-time linear systems and their analysis. It involved developing and analyzing linear system models.

### Assignment 2: Finite-time Optimal Control
- **Description**: This task requires the design of an optimal control law over a finite time horizon for a given system. The goal is to optimize the system's performance while adhering to the time constraints.

### Assignment 3: Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
- **Description**: This assignment focuses on implementing and analyzing a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The LQR method minimizes a quadratic cost function and aims for optimal control of linear systems.

### Assignment 4: Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- **Description**: This task explores the implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC). The MPC approach optimizes control actions over a moving time horizon while considering system constraints and disturbances.

## Project: Nonlinear MPC for Astrobee Rendezvous
- **Description**: This project involves developing a nonlinear MPC to manage the rendezvous maneuver of the Astrobee robot in space. The primary focus is on creating a robust controller that can handle potential thruster failures or other uncertainties during the operation.
