# Model Predictive Control (MPC) Assignments

This repository contains the coursework for the **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** module. The assignments focus on various control methods, particularly finite-time optimal control, Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR), and nonlinear MPC with a specific focus on an Astrobee rendezvous maneuver. Below is a breakdown of the included assignments and their topics:

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Discrete-time Linear Systems
- **Description**: This assignment introduces the state-feedback control design for the Astrobee robot, which operates on the International Space Station (ISS). The goal is to develop efficient control systems to manage the motion of the robot, which uses air to move via vents. In this assignment, the task is to implement a discrete-time linear model of the Astrobee system and design a feedback controller. The task also includes simulating the robotâ€™s behavior under the designed control strategy using Python scripts and analyzing its stability and performance.
  
### Assignment 2: Finite-time Optimal Control
- **Description**: This task requires the design of an optimal control law over a finite time horizon for a given system. The goal is to optimize the system's performance while adhering to the time constraints.

### Assignment 3: Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
- **Description**: This assignment focuses on implementing and analyzing a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The LQR method minimizes a quadratic cost function and aims for optimal control of linear systems.

### Assignment 4: Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- **Description**: This task explores the implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC). The MPC approach optimizes control actions over a moving time horizon while considering system constraints and disturbances.

## Project: Nonlinear MPC for Astrobee Rendezvous
- **Description**: This project involves developing a nonlinear MPC to manage the rendezvous maneuver of the Astrobee robot in space. The primary focus is on creating a robust controller that can handle potential thruster failures or other uncertainties during the operation.
